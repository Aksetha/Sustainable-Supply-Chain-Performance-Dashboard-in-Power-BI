# Week-1
I have created 4 tables named Inventory, Manufacturing, Supplier, and Supply Chain using Power BI. Unwanted rows were deleted from the duplicated tables. These tables were created by duplicating the original table multiple times. After duplication, the tables were renamed accordingly to the specified names.
